Running Prototypes
========================

Several prototype services are available as examples of how children's information services can built using the framework.

* **aMuSe**: a multimedia search interface for children, allows children to search for videos & images and to be able the explore these results, via the automatic generation of new queries.
* **BaSe**: Basic Search - a bare bones search service with no frills.
* **IfSe**: Information Foraging Search - an application created as a tutorial (see: :ref:`information-foraging-puppyir-tutorial`) for using the PuppyIR framework to create and manage a pipeline.
* **MaSe**: Create Your Own Mash-Up Search Interface: an application created as a tutorial (see: :ref:`mase-mash-up-search-engine-puppyir-tutorial`) for using PuppyIR to create a customisable web application and in doing so, introduce web programming to school children.
* **SeSu**: Search and Suggest - a search service which filters results by their suitability for children as well as providing search suggestions for new queries.
* **YouSee**: A Video Browsing Application for Young Children - a search service where children can browse moderated video content using a novel interactive paradigm.

Downloading the Prototypes
--------------------------

All the prototypes require Django to be installed to use them. If you do not have Django installed, then please visit the :ref:`requirements_and_installation` page and install it before downloading the prototypes.

In addition, IfSe and MaSe also require Whoosh to be installed and so if you want to run these prototypes please visit the installation page, as detailed above, and install Whoosh.

The source code for all these prototype services can then be downloaded with the following command:

:: 

  $ svn co https://puppyir.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/puppyir/trunk/prototypes prototypes

To download a specific prototype, use the command as follows - substituting in the name of the prototype you want to download. If you do this, you will need to amend the paths accordingly to run the prototypes by removing the 'prototypes' part of the path as noted in the **run** sections below. The command would, in this case, be:

::

  $ svn co https://puppyir.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/puppyir/trunk/prototypes/<APPNAME> <APPNAME>
  

Using aMuSe: A Multimedia Search Interface for Children
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

aMuSe allows video and picture results to be retrieved from YouTube and Bing's image search services. The results are then randomly (albeit, with a left-right-top-bottom approximation of relevance) arranged in a collage of images and videos. Videos can be played in-line; clicking on an image will generate a new query which will return a new collage of results.

aMuSe is only compatible with Python Version 2.7 - if you have an earlier or later version then please install Python 2.7 to use this prototype.

The three different methods for generating new queries are:

* **Query Drift**: a new query is generated by randomly removing terms and randomly adding terms to the original query. The terms selected are drawn from the snippets associated to the results on the page or from the snippet itself.
* **Query Specify**: a new query is generated from the snippet text associated with the image by appending the next most informative term to the original query. This generally produces more specific and focused queries that narrow the search results.
* **Query Repeat**: the same query is used again, but this time with a page offset so as to present results which would appear lower down in a ranked list.

Using BaSe: Basic Search
------------------------

This is a search application with a simple 'google-like' interface. It was created as both a tutorial (see: :ref:`building-a-puppyir-django-service`) and as a demo application to illustrate the ease at which interactive applications can be developed using the PuppyIR framework.

Using IfSe: Information Foraging Search
---------------------------------------

This prototype was created as a tutorial (see: :ref:`information-foraging-puppyir-tutorial`) designed to teach how to: retrieve results from multiple sources (search engine wrappers), log queries, generate query suggestions and how to create & manage result/query pipelines using the PuppyIR framework.

Using MaSe: Create Your Own Mash-Up Search Interface
----------------------------------------------------

MaSe is an application designed to allow children to create and customise their own search engine - retrieving results from a variety of sources in several different formats (e.g. web results, images, videos). See the MaSe tutorial for more details about the application :ref:`mase-mash-up-search-engine-puppyir-tutorial`.

Using SeSu: Search and Suggest
--------------------------------------------

SeSu is a prototype service that investigates the use of query suggestions and the effectiveness of the framework's suitability filter. This filter looks at individual results and evaluates their suitability for children; it then decides whether to accept or reject the result, based on a defined cutoff minimum score they should receive.

Using YouSee: A Video Browsing Application for Young Children
---------------------------------------------------------------

YouSee is a web application designed to allow young children to browse moderated video content (the videos are moderated and managed by their parents using the admin interface). The application aims to avoids the problems associated with text query formulation by young children by providing a novel interaction paradigm based on a globe of videos for children to explore. Conceptually the globe can be thought of as a series of carousels containing videos where the interaction paradigm allows two forms of browsing/scrolling:

1. in carousel to access similar and related content
2. between carousels to access different content.
