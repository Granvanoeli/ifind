<p class="triangle-isosceles"> Welcome to PageFetch, a fun game for kids and adults!<br /><br /> You have three minutes to help me fetch pages around the web using a search engine. You'll get more points the better your search is, and there are bonuses up for grabs if you don't throw pages away! <br /><br />Enjoy the game! </br></br></p>
