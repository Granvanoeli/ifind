King Hussein, peace

How significant a figure over the years was the late Jordanian King Hussein in furthering peace in the Middle East?

A relevant document must include mention of Israel; King Hussein himself as opposed to other Jordanian officials; discussion of the King's on-going, previous or upcoming efforts; and efforts pertinent to the peace process, not merely Jordan's relationship with other middle-east countries or the U.S.
