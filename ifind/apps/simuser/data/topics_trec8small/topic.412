airport security

What security measures are in effect or are proposed to go into effect in airports?

A relevant document could identify a specific airport and describe the security measures already in effect or proposed for use at that airport.  Relevant items could also describe a failure of security that was cited as a contributing cause of a tragedy which came to pass or which was later averted.  Comparisons between and among airports based on the effectiveness of the security of each are also relevant.
