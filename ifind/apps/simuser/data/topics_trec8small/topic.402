behavioral genetics

What is happening in the field of behavioral genetics, the study of the relative influence of genetic and environmental factors on an individual's behavior or personality?

Documents describing genetic or environmental factors relating to understanding and preventing substance abuse and addictions are relevant.  Documents pertaining to attention deficit disorders tied in with genetics are also relevant, as are genetic disorders affecting hearing or muscles.  The genome project is relevant when tied in with behavior disorders (i.e., mood disorders, Alzheimer's disease).
