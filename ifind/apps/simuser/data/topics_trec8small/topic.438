tourism, increase

What countries are experiencing an increase in tourism?

A relevant document will name a country that has experienced an increase in tourism. The increase must represent the nation as a whole and tourism in general, not be restricted to only certain regions of the country or to some specific type of tourism (e.g., adventure travel).  Documents discussing only projected increases are not relevant.
