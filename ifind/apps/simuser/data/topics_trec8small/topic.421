industrial waste disposal

How is the disposal of industrial waste being accomplished by industrial management throughout the world?

Documents that discuss the disposal, storage, or management of industrial waste---both standard and hazardous---are relevant.  However, documents that discuss disposal or storage of nuclear or radioactive waste, or the illegal shipment or dumping of waste to avoid legal disposal methods are not relevant.
