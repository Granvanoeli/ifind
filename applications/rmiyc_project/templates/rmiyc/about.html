    <h3>Retrieve me if you can!</h3>
    Retrieve me if you can is a game developed as a part of a research project in the department of computing science in the University of Glasgow. <br />
    The project considers using human computation game  to collect data to evaluate the hypothesis of the correlation between findability,
    which is how good the users are in retrieving information through searching, and retrievability which is how good the information retrieval system in accessing information. <br>
