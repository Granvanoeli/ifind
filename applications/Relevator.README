Relevator
---------


The aim of the game is to judge whether a document is relevant to a topic, or not.

Players are given a topic, then presented with snippets/documents.
Then then need to judge whether it is relevant to the topic.

Feedback on Whether they are correct or not is presented to the player:
either after a judgement has been made, or after a set has been judged.
