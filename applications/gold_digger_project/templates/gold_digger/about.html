            Gold Digger is a project by the <a href="http://www.gla.ac.uk">University of Glasgow</a> developed by Gabriele Rossi. Its objective is to gather information regarding user searching behaviour through the use of a metaphor.
            Although no data about user searches is actually gathered, this game/experiment hopes to uncover similarities between already existing data about user behaviour with new data gathered in a
            different context such as the present one. <br><br>
