            Gold Digger is a project by the <a href="http://www.gla.ac.uk">University of Glasgow</a> developed by Gabriele Rossi and supervised by Leif Azzopardi.
            It's objective is to provide a game that would act as a <b>metaphor for searching behavior</b>. In the same way as users of a web search engine tipe in queries to the system,
            so do the miners in gold digger access a mine showing different layers instead of different links. Each layer/link will hold a certain amount of gold just as each link in a web search will
            hold a certain amount of information that might be more or less useful to us. With this game/experiment we hope to find a correspondence between the two behaviors and hopefully
            let users have fun!<br><br>
