# how to use externally,
# from logger_example import event_logger
# event_logger.info("an info message, perhaps to say a user issued a query")

# or once the event_log log is created you can (and should) ask for the logger by name,
#  and then log to it.
# test_logger = logging.getLogger("event_log")
# test_logger.info("a test msg")
